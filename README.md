## **Project Purpose & Goal**
Mapty is a demonstration of my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The primary goal of this project was to create a workout logging application, enhancing my JavaScript skills and exploring its diverse functionalities. The application's key feature is the ability to log recent workouts on a map, thanks to the integration of the Leaflet library.

## **Technologies Used**
For this project, I harnessed the power of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. I acquired these skills through active participation in a comprehensive Udemy course that focused on JavaScript, particularly emphasizing the use of JavaScript classes. Additionally, I integrated geolocation to enable users to log their workouts with precise location data from their current location. This application stands as one of my most complex creations to date, providing me with an exciting opportunity to delve into the depths of JavaScript and its capabilities.

## **Design & Thought Process**
The creation of Mapty hinged on crafting a user-friendly interface that seamlessly empowered users to explore its functionality. It was primarily designed as a platform for mastering JavaScript classes and the various ways they can be manipulated.

The journey began with the development of the user interface, thoughtfully designed using HTML and CSS. Subsequently, the application's mapping functionality was introduced through the integration of the Leaflet library, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. However, the heart of the application lies in its JavaScript code.

Initially, my online course guided me in creating simple functionality. But as the project evolved, I expanded its capabilities. Users can now edit and delete their previously entered workouts, and they receive clear error and success messages to enhance their understanding of the process.

Mapty is not just a testament to my skills but a functional tool for users to log and manage their workouts effectively.


## **Things I Learned**
* JavaScript Classes
* Class Inheritance
* Geolocation
* Advanced DOM Manipulation
* Intergration of External Libraries
* Dynamic HTML Creation
* Data Management
* Error Handling / Feedback
* Using Local Storage
